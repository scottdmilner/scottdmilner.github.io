**PipeBot** is a Discord bot I created to help manage the pipeline for my senior thesis film. 

- **Source Code:** [scottdmilner/pipebot](https://github.com/scottdmilner/pipebot)
- **Technologies:** Python ([aiohttp](https://aiohttp.org), [disnake](https://disnake.dev/), [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)), Docker Compose

PipeBot is deployed in a container with Docker Compose, using NGINX and Let's Encrypt for SSL security.

PipeBot's Discord profile

Most importantly, **PipeBot** provides a simple way for artists on the team to log bug reports and feature requests on GitHub without needing to make a GitHub account or navigate Github.

The artist's bug reporting experience

**PipeBot** also processes webhooks from ShotGrid and from pipeline tools running inside DCCs and broadcasts those messages to the team.
