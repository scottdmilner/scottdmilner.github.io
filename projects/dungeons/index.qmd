*Love & Gold*
:::

***Love & Gold*** is the BYU Center for Animation's 2025 short film capstone, about a meet-cute between two crypt robbbers. I was the lead Pipeline TD on this film, supporting ~50 artists with a fresh USD-based pipeline solution architected from the ground up. 

Read about BYU's transition to USD in our SIGGRAPH 2025 paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721242.3734008).
