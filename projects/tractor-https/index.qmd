**tractor-https** adds SSL security and PAM authentication to Pixar's Tractor renderfarm manager.

- **Source Code:** [scottdmilner/tractor-https](https://github.com/scottdmilner/tractor-https)
- **Technologies:** Docker Compose, NGINX, Python, Bash

**tractor-https** is deployed at Brigham Young University and has rendered two senior capstone films.

Out of the box, Pixar's Tractor renderfarm manager sends all traffic as unencrypted TCP traffic (mostly HTTP). It requires the studio to implement any security features, including password authentication. **tractor-https** was created to facilitate attaching BYU Animation's Tractor instance to the CS Department's FreeIPA authentication system.

**tractor-https** structure
:::

Since FreeIPA works through Linux `sssd`, we can create a custom PAM module for Tractor to authenticate with. This requires plaintext passwords to be delivered to the `tractor-engine` service so it can verify them against the PAM module. To secure this, **tractor-https** uses NGINX to wrap all HTTP trafic coming from `tractor-engine` in an SSL layer and transmits it on port 443 instead of 80.

`tractor-engine` does not have support for features such as the `X-Forwarded-For` header that simplify the SSL proxying process, so I use host mode networking to create a fully transparent SSL proxy.

In order to communicate with the Tractor Engine via HTTPS, the Tractor Python API needs to be patched to wrap messages in an SSL layer (patch is included in the repo).

The `crew-sync.sh` script regularly queries the host system for updates to the `admin` and `wrangler` groups, then updates the `crews.config` file and notifies the `tractor-engine` service of the change.
