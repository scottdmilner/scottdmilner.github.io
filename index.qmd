## Hello 👋

My name is Scott, I'm a Computer Science Master's student studying graphics at Stanford 🌲. I build software that helps artists and fellow developers get their work done more efficiently. 

In my undergrad, I studied Computer Science, focusing on CG/Animation/VFX pipelines and software development at Brigham Young University 🛠⚙️.

Things I've been working on recently:

- I interned with the RenderMan team at Pixar Animation Studios, working on improvements to the RenderMan Texture Manager and OpenImageIO. My work will be included in the upcoming RenderMan 27 release.
- I presented at ACM SIGGRAPH 2025! Check out our presentation on adapting OpenUSD as a small studio [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721239.3734118) and our presentation on virtualizing artist workstations [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721242.3734008).
- I finished up my senior animation capstone—an animated short about a meet-cute in a crypt! I architected our USD-based pipeline from scratch. Feel free to read about it [here](/code-projects/dungeon-pipeline) or check out the code directly [on Github](https://github.com/scottdmilner/dungeon-pipeline). This code base also served as a base for a film capstone the following year and three video game capstones. 

Big into: USD, Houdini, board games, and 400 year-old music
