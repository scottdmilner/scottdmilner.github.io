# Hello 👋

My name is Scott, I'm a Computer Science student studying CG/Animation/VFX pipelines at Brigham Young University 🛠⚙️.

I'm currently deep in my senior capstone—an animated short about a meet-cute in a crypt. I've architected our pipeline from scratch, feel free to check out all my work at dungeon-pipeline!

Big into: USD, Houdini, board games, and 400 year-old music

## Check out some of my recent projects below!
