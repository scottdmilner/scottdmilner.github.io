## Hello 👋

My name is Scott, I'm a Computer Science Master's student studying graphics at Stanford 🌲.

In my undergrad, I studied Computer Science, focusing on CG/Animation/VFX pipelines and software development at Brigham Young University 🛠⚙️.

Things I've been working on recently:

- I presented at ACM SIGGRAPH 2025! Check out both of our presetations [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721239.3734118) and [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721242.3734008).
- I finished up my senior animation capstone—an animated short about a meet-cute in a crypt! I architected our USD-based pipeline from scratch. Feel free to read about it [here](/code-projects/dungeon-pipeline) or check out the code directly [on Github](https://github.com/scottdmilner/dungeon-pipeline).

Big into: USD, Houdini, board games, and 400 year-old music
