## Hello 👋

My name is Scott, I'm a Computer Science student studying CG/Animation/VFX pipelines and software development at Brigham Young University 🛠⚙️.

I'm currently deep in my senior capstone—an animated short about a meet-cute in a crypt. I've architected our pipeline from scratch. Feel free to read about it [here](/code-projects/dungeon-pipeline) or check out the code directly [on Github](https://github.com/scottdmilner/dungeon-pipeline)!

Big into: USD, Houdini, board games, and 400 year-old music
