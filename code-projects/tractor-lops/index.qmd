**Tractor LOPs** are a set of Houdini HDAs for streamlining the process of sending render jobs to a Tractor renderfarm.

- **Technologies:** Tractor Python API, Houdini HDA

**Tractor LOPs** is designed to be a drop-in solution for sending complex renderfarm jobs to Tractor without leaving the Solaris LOP context. It was designed with the needs of [**Dungeon Pipeline**](../dungeon-pipeline/) in mind, but intended to be flexible enough that other students can use it to deploy their personal projects to the renderfarm when there is headroom.

Artists can create as many *Tractor Configure* nodes as needed and feed them all into the *Tractor Submit* node. This allows them to quickly wedge various lighting rigs or render setting configurations within the LOP context without needing to use TOPs. All streams are submitted as a single job to Tractor.

Denoising with the RenderMan denoiser can be configured with the *Tractor Denoise* node. This includes support for denoising arbitrary AOVs, sorting them based off `diffuse_` and `specular_` prefixes, if provided.
