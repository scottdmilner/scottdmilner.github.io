I joined the **Accomplice Pipeline** team in July of 2023. My work on **Accomplice Pipeline** primarily consisted of 

- Troubleshooting artists' issues around the clock and providing bugfixes
- Improving developer QoL by hosting the project on GitHub and writing documentation and training on creating local project copies.
- Adding functionality to Tractor spooling, including denoising with the RenderMan 26 denoiser and generating preview `.mov` files of rendered `.exr`s.
- Render wrangling and renderfarm monitoring and scripting to keep all farm blades working productively.


**Accomplice Pipeline** was succeeded by [**Dungeon Pipeline**](/code-projects/dungeon-pipeline)
